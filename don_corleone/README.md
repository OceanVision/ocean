# Don Corleone

Don Corleone is a server that can be used to easily admin the Ocean cluster
or check Ocean status, etc. run_node script is an easy way to join our node
to the cluster. In case of failure (repeatiting responsibilities etc.) it
should inform you about the problem. run_node will run all the services and register the node.
You should not run services yourself!

**Important note**: you can register each service as local, or not. If it is local, then you can
register another instance, and it will be used only by you. If it is global, you cannot
register more than one instance.

Sidenote: For checking Hadoop cluster status we will use Hue service (included in Cloudera package).

**Note**: if you decide not to run don_corleone and not to connect to global
don corleone because you are a strange person - there a mechanism that will
make it work anyway: get_configuration if server is inaccessible with pull your
config from config.json and return values if there is defined service in
node_responsibilities

### Installation

    1. Configure ssh (as in wiki) - basically add your key from ocean don
       server to your computer and create ssh user with access to your ocean directory.
      **If you want to run locally don** - configure ssh so that you can fire
    for instance ssh staszek@localhost without password prompt.

    2. Prepare config.json file

### Configuration file

Please see config.json : it should explain everything.

You have to specify following items:

* master: url of master

* master_local_url: url of local server (do not change in most cases)

* master_local: true/false : if true, run_node will run don_corleone first

* responsibilties: what responsibilities is this node registering. Options:

    * neo4j

    * lionfish

    * kafka (not implemented)

Each responsibility is a list of name and additional options.

**Important note**: You add option local: this will make this service local (and accessible only by your computer)

Don corleone additional options:
    
    * service_id - it overrides default service id

Exemplary additional options.

    * for news_fetcher_slave "id" (default id is 0)

    * for ODM (lionfish) "port" (default port is 7777)

    * for neo4j "port" (default port is 7474)

* home: path to your ocean directory

### NAT configuration

Important bits: it is using reversed ssh mechanism (please see online resources
for more information). 

To use NAT support you have to complete two steps:

* Add "reversed:true" to your config.json (see config.json.reversed)

* Add your key from master server (run ssh-copy-id your_user@your_domain from
  don machine)

### Running
`sudo -E python2 run_node.py` should run node accordingly to the configuration file. If it is
a master it will run the master service. And for every configuration it will register
to the master responsibilities.

-E option in sudo preserves environment. It is very important !

In case of problems see wiki, and run test_don_corleone_slave.py file.

### Fetching configuration

The main idea is that modules can fetch configuration from the webserivce. The function
is defined in ocean_admin/utils.py

Usage: get_configuration(service_name, config_name). For exemplary usage see lionfish
Usage: get_configuration_service_id(service_id, config_name). Gets configuration using precise service_id, not service_name (
you would use it after having overriden service_id in config.json)

### Stoping

Hit ctrl+C , run_node.py should terminate the responsibilities and deregister. (Not implemented yet)
